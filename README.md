## 📌 Overview
Quad-Segretronics is an intelligent waste-management platform that combines AI, IoT sensing, and cloud-driven analytics to modernize how waste is tracked, sorted, and collected. The system continuously monitors bin conditions, predicts collection needs, and improves operational workflows. By optimizing routes and automating waste identification, it supports cleaner environments and cost-efficient waste handling.
